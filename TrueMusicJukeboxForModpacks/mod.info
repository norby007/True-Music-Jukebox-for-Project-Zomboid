description= <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7> Adds a jukebox that can play cassettes and vinyls from True Music mods! <LINE>  <LINE> Now syncs music on multiplayer! <LINE>  <LINE> Are you tired of swapping cassettes? Is the effort to find batteries for that walkman draining? Are those record player speakers just getting out of hand? <LINE>  <LINE> 1. Get True Music (and it's prerequisites) <LINE> 2. Get some music for True Music <LINE> 3. Subscribe to some good True Music track packs. <LINE> 4. Find or build yourself an epic jukebox (but don't forget electricity)! <LINE> 5. Turn it on, fill it with cassettes and vinyls, and crank it up to ELEVEN! * <LINE>  <LINE>  <RGB:1.0,0.6,0.0> How to Use Jukeboxes <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7>  <LINE>  <LINE> To use a jukebox, simply interact with it once after finding or placing it in the world and turn it on. This will convert the jukebox into a container object, at which point you can move (or "load") True Music cassettes and vinyls into the jukebox. Once tracks have been loaded, you can play them using either any loaded track's inventory menu or the jukebox interaction menu. If a jukebox is on, it will continuously play its loaded tracks until you turn it off again. <LINE>  <LINE> Jukeboxes can hold ELEVENTY arbitrary Zomboid weight units (110 AZWU) of your finest tapes and vinyl records. Furthermore, you can create a queue of specific tracks that will play next in the loaded playlist, and you can lock the queue if you want to loop through a subset of loaded tracks. <LINE>  <LINE> Aside from the weight capacity of the jukebox, this mod doesn't place any limit on the number of tracks a jukebox can hold; they hold eleventy AZWU of tracks, so mods that lower the weight of your items will also increase the capacity of the jukebox (without limit). Be aware, however, that jukebox updates in the current version will be slower for jukeboxes with hundreds of songs. <LINE>  <LINE> By default, zombies will be attracted to the sound of the jukebox up to 125 squares away (or less if the audible sound distance set in your sandbox options is lower than 125). This can be disabled in the sandbox. <LINE>  <LINE> * Please adjust Ambient Volume in the vanilla sound settings if jukeboxes are too loud or quiet for you at the volume your friends prefer. <LINE>  <RGB:1.0,0.6,0.0> Jukebox Icons <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7>  <LINE>  <LINE> This mod features icons to help people navigate its menus nonverbally. All buttons still do what their button text says they will do; buttons that say "play", "enable", or "turn on" do exactly that. However, the icon for buttons that toggle things on and off will reflect the CURRENT state of that option, [b]not[/b] the state it will be in after it's pressed. We made this decision because we wanted the icons to appear "on" when the associated toggle is "on" - the Jukebox icon is green when it's on, the Looping Queue icon is queue-colored when it's on (something between orange and gold), and the Portable Jukebox Key button is yellow when it's on. This pattern can be inverted using Mod Options if it is not intuitive to you. <LINE>  <LINE>  <RGB:1.0,0.6,0.0> Portable Jukebox Keys <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7>  <LINE>  <LINE> Enable portable jukebox keys in the sandbox to allow players to access their jukeboxes from a distance by interacting with their keyring in their primary inventory. To be clear, this ability is added to the context menu of your key rings; it will not add physical keys to your key ring. <LINE>  <LINE>  <RGB:1.0,0.6,0.0> Range Options <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7>  <LINE>  <LINE> In sandbox options, you can determine the audible sound range of the jukebox; note, however, that this feature only works if you use our custom sound mode (the default sound mode of this mod). If you are using Project Zomboid's 3D sound effects, however, be aware that we are not able to control the sound range; it will drop off in volume according to whatever is deemed realistic by Project Zomboid. <LINE>  <LINE>  <RGB:1.0,0.6,0.0> Jukebox Hero <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7>  <LINE>  <LINE> Want to get a jukebox as fast as possible? Just choose the Jukebox Hero trait at character creation, and you will spawn with a Jukebox Starter Kit for building your very own jam station! You will also learn a recipe for screwing together a boombox, a record player, and some metal to make jukeboxes out of scrap. <LINE>  <LINE> Jukebox Starter Kits (which can be used to easily build a jukebox) and Jukebox Instruction Manuals (which can teach you to construct your own box from either starter kits or scrap) can be found in various locations, including crates, shelves, and wardrobes. Also, anyone who has reached level 4 as an electrician will know how to build one, even if they don't have this trait. We included sandbox options for making these items easier or harder to find. <LINE>  <LINE>  <RGB:1.0,0.6,0.0> 3D Audio Effects <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7>  <LINE>  <LINE> True Music boomboxes and cassette players use 3D audio effects that many people find annoying because they have excessive bias toward one ear, and that ear is often the wrong ear (it's based on player position, not head orientation). We do not like the sound of that audio, so we replaced it with something we like much better. However, you may enable that form of 3D audio using both Mod Options (for the individual level) and sandbox options (if you want to force your entire server to use the same 3D sound as True Music). Just be aware that we do not control the audible range of that sound; we only control the range of our custom 3D audio mode (the default used by this mod).
