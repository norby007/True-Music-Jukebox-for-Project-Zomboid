description= <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7> Adds a jukebox that can play cassettes and vinyls from True Music mods! <LINE>  <LINE> Now syncs music on multiplayer! <LINE>  <LINE> Are you tired of swapping cassettes? Is the effort to find batteries for that walkman draining? Are those record player speakers just getting out of hand? <LINE>  <LINE> 1. Get True Music (and it's prerequisites) <LINE> 2. Get some music for True Music <LINE> 3. Go get (or build) yourself an epic jukebox! <LINE> 4. Turn it on (but don't forget electricity) and crank it up to ELEVEN!* <LINE>  <LINE>  <RGB:1.0,0.6,0.0> How to Use Jukeboxes <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7>  <LINE>  <LINE> This little darling will now hold ELEVENTY arbitrary Zomboid weight units (110 AZWU) of your finest tapes and vinyl records. You can insert them in the order that you want them to initially play, but you can also shuffle the playlist's order after dumping a huge collection into the box (note that the inventory panel will no longer reflect the playlist order after shuffling). Furthermore, you can create a queue of specific tracks that will play next in the playlist. Once the queue is finished playing, the jukebox will continue playing from the other tracks that have been loaded into it. <LINE>  <LINE> "So how many tracks can I load?" Aside from the weight capacity of the jukebox, this mod doesn't place any limit on the number of tracks a jukebox can hold; they hold eleventy AZWU of tracks, so mods that lower the weight of your items will also increase the capacity of the jukebox (without limit). <LINE>  <LINE> When you interact with tracks that are inside of a jukebox (or with the jukebox itself), you can play specific tracks from the jukebox, queue tracks, skip tracks, replay tracks, jump to random tracks, and even shuffle the entire playlist (just be aware that random selection and shuffling will erase the queue). <LINE>  <LINE> If the jukebox has tracks and electricity, the party WILL NOT STOP! (So, if you want to be a buzzkill, just turn off the jukebox.) <LINE>  <LINE> Set this up with dancing zombies and have a house party!** <LINE>  <LINE> Of course, some of you must be wondering, "But will it attract the zombie love interest of my dreams?" <LINE>  <LINE> Naturally, it will attract them all! Take your pick! Of course, if you don't care to lure cannabilistic hippies to your party, we have a switch for that... Go play in the sandbox for more information. <LINE>  <LINE> You can store all sorts of other crap in a jukebox too, but trash doesn't produce any good tunes. <LINE>  <LINE> * For those times when you need something one louder than ten. Mod authors not responsible for zombie invasion or police presence due to loud obnoxious music (there's a sandbox option for disabling that, so that's on you). <LINE>  <LINE> ** Real friends not included, but MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT IS! <LINE>  <LINE>  <RGB:1.0,0.6,0.0> Jukebox Hero <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7>  <LINE>  <LINE> Want to get a jukebox as fast as possible? Just choose the Jukebox Hero trait at character creation, and you will spawn with a Jukebox Starter Kit for building your very own jam station! You will also learn a recipe for screwing together a boombox, a record player, and some metal to make jukeboxes out of scrap. <LINE>  <LINE> Jukebox Starter Kits (which can be used to easily build a jukebox) and Jukebox Instruction Manuals (which can teach you to construct your own box from both starter kits and scrap) can be found in various locations, including crates, shelves, and wardrobes. Also, anyone who has reached level 4 as an electrician will know how to build one, even if they don't have this trait. This mod was primarily tested with a loot frequency multiplier (for books and starter kits) of 1, with Loot Rarity for Literature and Other set to Normal. Sandbox options have been included for changing the frequency with which you will find starter kits and instruction manuals in the places they tend to be found.
