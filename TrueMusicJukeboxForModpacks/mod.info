description= <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7> Adds a jukebox that can play cassettes and vinyls from True Music mods! <LINE>  <LINE> Now syncs music on multiplayer! <LINE>  <LINE> Are you tired of swapping cassettes? Is the effort to find batteries for that walkman draining? Are those record player speakers just getting out of hand? <LINE>  <LINE> 1. Get True Music (and it's prerequisites) <LINE> 2. Get some music for True Music <LINE> 3. Go get (or build) yourself an epic jukebox! <LINE> 4. Turn it on (but don't forget electricity) and crank it up to ELEVEN!* <LINE>  <LINE>  <RGB:1.0,0.6,0.0> How to Use Jukeboxes <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7>  <LINE>  <LINE> This little darling will now hold ELEVENTY arbitrary Zomboid weight units (110 AZWU) of your finest tapes and vinyl records. You can insert them in the order that you want them to initially play, but you can also shuffle the playlist's order after dumping a huge collection into the box (note that the inventory panel will no longer reflect the playlist order after shuffling). Furthermore, you can create a queue of specific tracks that will play next in the playlist. Once the queue is finished playing, the jukebox will continue playing from the other tracks that have been loaded into it. <LINE>  <LINE> "So how many tracks can I load?" Aside from the weight capacity of the jukebox, this mod doesn't place any limit on the number of tracks a jukebox can hold; they hold eleventy AZWU of tracks, so mods that lower the weight of your items will also increase the capacity of the jukebox (without limit). <LINE>  <LINE> When you interact with tracks that are inside of a jukebox (or with the jukebox itself), you can play specific tracks from the jukebox, queue tracks, lock (or unlock) queues, skip tracks, replay tracks, jump to random tracks, and even shuffle the entire playlist (just be aware that random selection and shuffling will erase the queue). Note that the tracklists in the context menu will limit the visible tracks (due to potential performance issues on slower computers) to the nearest 50 tracks in Jukebox Playlist and the next 30 tracks in Jukebox Queue unless you disable these limits using Mod Options (Options > Mods). Rest assured that every track in your jukebox IS in the playlist, even if you cannot see it. Finally, every loaded track can always be explored and managed using the loot panel (which loads MUCH faster than the world context menu for this purpose). <LINE>  <LINE> If the jukebox has tracks and electricity, the party WILL NOT STOP! (So, if you want to be a buzzkill, just turn off the jukebox.) <LINE>  <LINE> Set this up with dancing zombies and have a house party!** <LINE>  <LINE> Of course, some of you must be wondering, "But will it attract the zombie love interest of my dreams?" <LINE>  <LINE> Naturally, it will attract them all! Take your pick! Of course, if you don't care to lure cannabilistic hippies to your party, we have a switch for that... Go play in the sandbox for more information. <LINE>  <LINE> * For those times when you need something one louder than ten. Mod authors not responsible for zombie invasion or police presence due to loud obnoxious music (there's a sandbox option for disabling that, so that's on you). Please adjust Ambient Volume in the vanilla sound settings if jukeboxes are too loud or quiet for you at the volume your friends prefer. <LINE>  <LINE> ** Real friends not included, but MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT IS! <LINE>  <LINE>  <RGB:1.0,0.6,0.0> Jukebox Hero <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7>  <LINE>  <LINE> Want to get a jukebox as fast as possible? Just choose the Jukebox Hero trait at character creation, and you will spawn with a Jukebox Starter Kit for building your very own jam station! You will also learn a recipe for screwing together a boombox, a record player, and some metal to make jukeboxes out of scrap. <LINE>  <LINE> Jukebox Starter Kits (which can be used to easily build a jukebox) and Jukebox Instruction Manuals (which can teach you to construct your own box from both starter kits and scrap) can be found in various locations, including crates, shelves, and wardrobes. Also, anyone who has reached level 4 as an electrician will know how to build one, even if they don't have this trait. We included sandbox options for making these items easier or harder to find. <LINE>  <LINE>  <RGB:1.0,0.6,0.0> Multiplayer Sync <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7>  <LINE>  <LINE> We have spent untold hours confirming that you will hear the same songs as other people, and tracks will change at approximately the same time; unfortunately, there is no way to guarantee absolutely perfect musical sync in Project Zomboid from Lua to our knowledge. In practice, there are limitations; if you join a server late or arrive late to a party, we cannot begin the song partially-complete up to the point that the song has played for the other clients. In that case, when the song changes for them, the song will change early for you, and then you should remain nearly perfectly synced, no matter where you travel on the server. <LINE>  <LINE>  <RGB:1.0,0.6,0.0> 3D Audio Effects <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7>  <LINE>  <LINE> True Music uses 3D audio effects by default that many people find annoying because they have excessive bias toward one ear, and that ear is often the wrong ear (it's based on player position, not head orientation). We do not like the sound of that audio, so we replaced it with something we like much better. However, you may enable that form of 3D audio using both Mod Options (for the individual level) and sandbox options (if you want to force your entire server to use the same 3D sound as True Music). Just be aware that we do not control the audible range of vanilla 3D sound using our sandbox options.
